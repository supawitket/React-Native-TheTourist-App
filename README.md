# React-Native-TheTourist-App
My Senior Project in React Native

First I made my senior project in Ionic and Angular but the problem I was having was the low performance when it comes to a real-time loading application, so I have switched to React Native which gives better performance.

To get this running: you must have React Native installed on your laptop (instruction: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
